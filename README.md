## What is this?

A simple compiler made in Python, designed to compile IGCSE pseudocode to C code

## But why?
I don't know, really. I just got bored one day and decided, yeah I'll push my skills to the max and build a somewhat-usable compiler I guess

Did I overestimate myself? Definitely yes. Will it be fun suffering through this project? Probably, depends if this will interfere with my revision for exams...


### Status: In Development
